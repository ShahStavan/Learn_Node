### What is Node JS?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling them to build server-side applications with JavaScript. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
1. <b>What is Open-Source?</b>
    Open source refers to a software development model in which the source code of a program or application is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute it. This means that the code can be freely shared and modified by developers around the world, without any restriction or licensing fees.
2. <b>What is Cross-Platform?</b>
    Cross-platform refers to the ability of software or applications to run on multiple operating systems or platforms. This means that a program can be developed on one platform, such as Windows, and then run on another platform, such as Mac OS X or Linux, without requiring any changes to the code.
3. <b>What is Server-Side Javascript runtime environment?</b>
    A server-side JavaScript runtime environment is a platform that allows developers to run JavaScript code on a server, outside of a web browser. This allows developers to create and run server-side applications using JavaScript, which was traditionally only used for client-side programming.

    One popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment is Node.js. Node.js is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. It allows developers to build scalable, efficient, and real-time applications using JavaScript.

### What are features of Node JS?
Node.js is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment that provides a range of features for developers. Some of the top features of Node.js include:

1. Non-blocking I/O: Node.js provides a non-blocking I/O model that allows it to handle a large number of requests and connections simultaneously, without blocking the event loop.

2. Asynchronous programming: Node.js allows developers to write asynchronous code using callbacks, promises, and async/await, making it easier to handle multiple requests and perform I/O operations efficiently.

3. Fast performance: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which provides fast performance and allows Node.js to execute JavaScript code very quickly.

4. Scalability: Node.js is designed to be highly scalable, making it easy to handle large amounts of traffic and scale up or down as needed.

5. Cross-platform compatibility: Node.js is cross-platform, meaning that it can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

6. Large ecosystem: Node.js has a large and growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easier for developers to build applications quickly and efficiently.

7. Community support: Node.js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the platform, provide support, and create new tools and libraries to enhance the capabilities of Node.js.

Overall, these features make Node.js a popular choice for building scalable, efficient, and real-time applications using JavaScript.

### How Node works behind the hood?
Node.js works behind the hood by providing a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. Here's a brief overview of how Node.js works:

1. When a Node.js application is started, it creates a single thread of execution, called the event loop, which is responsible for managing all I/O operations and handling events.
    1. <b>What is an event-loop?</b>
        <br>
        In Node.js, the event loop is a core part of the runtime environment that enables asynchronous I/O operations and handles events. The event loop is responsible for managing all I/O operations, including reading and writing to files, network requests, and database interactions.

        The event loop works by constantly checking the event queue for new events to process. When an event is added to the queue, the event loop will pick it up and handle it. Events in Node.js can be triggered by various sources, including timers, I/O operations, and user-defined events.

        One important aspect of the event loop is that it uses a non-blocking I/O model, which means that it doesn't block the execution of the program while waiting for I/O operations to complete. Instead, Node.js registers callbacks to be called when I/O operations are complete, allowing other operations to be processed in the meantime.

        The event loop is designed to be highly efficient and can handle a large number of concurrent events and I/O operations. This makes Node.js well-suited for building real-time and scalable applications, such as web servers and APIs, chat applications, and game servers.

2. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle multiple requests and connections simultaneously, without blocking the event loop.

3. When a request is received, Node.js creates an event and adds it to the event queue. The event loop then continuously checks the event queue for new events, and processes each event in turn.

4. Asynchronous callbacks are used to handle I/O operations, such as reading or writing files, making network requests, or interacting with databases. When an I/O operation is initiated, Node.js doesn't block the event loop, but instead registers a callback function to be called when the operation is complete.

5. Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop, but can handle multiple concurrent connections by delegating I/O operations to the operating system kernel, which can handle multiple threads or processes.

6. Node.js also provides a module system that allows developers to organize their code into reusable modules, which can be loaded and executed on demand.

Overall, Node.js provides a flexible and efficient runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable, efficient, and real-time applications using JavaScript.

### What are Asynchoronous-Callbacks and Promises in Node JS?
Asynchronous callbacks are functions that are executed after an asynchronous operation is completed. For example, when reading a file using the fs module in Node.js, you can provide a callback function to be executed when the file has been read. This callback function will be called asynchronously, meaning that the program will continue to execute while the file is being read. Asynchronous callbacks are often used in Node.js to handle I/O operations, network requests, and other types of asynchronous operations.

Promises are another way of handling asynchronous operations in Node.js. A promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet. Promises can be used to handle asynchronous operations by returning a promise object instead of a callback function. The promise object represents the eventual completion of the operation, and can be used to chain multiple asynchronous operations together.

Promises have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their simplicity and ease of use. Promises are easy to reason about, and provide a more structured way of handling asynchronous operations than traditional callback functions.

Overall, asynchronous callbacks and promises are two important features of Node.js that allow developers to write efficient and non-blocking code for handling I/O operations and other types of asynchronous tasks.

### What are installation and setup steps of Node JS?
1. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system from the official Node.js website 
<a href="https://nodejs.org">Node JS</a>.

2. Double-click the installer to begin the installation process.

3. Follow the prompts in the installer to select the installation directory and other settings.

4. Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and type <b><i>node -v</i></b> to verify that Node.js is installed and working correctly. This command will display the version number of Node.js that is currently installed on your system.

5. To start using Node.js, you can <b>create a new JavaScript file with a .js extension</b> and begin writing code. You can run the file using the node command in the terminal, followed by the name of the file. For example, if you have a<b> file called example.js</b>, you can run it using the following command: <b><i>node example.js.</i></b>

That's it! With Node.js installed and set up, you can now start building applications using the Node.js runtime environment and its extensive ecosystem of modules and packages.
